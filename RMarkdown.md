# R Markdown Basics

## YAML Metadata

The R Markdown template begins with a block of YAML [^Yet Another Markup Language] metadata.  This metadata is used by tools such as Pandoc and knitr when generating reports.  While these tools support multiple metadata options, for now we will use the following metadata items. 

```yaml
---
title: "ASSIGNMENT 4"
author: "Firstname Lastname"
date: '2010-02-14'
output:
  html_document: default
bibliography: bibliography.bib
---
```

The bibliography metadata points to the file `bibliography.bib` which contains a BibTeX formatted bibliography.  You create BibTeX formatted bibliographies using a standard text editor or generate them using tools like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).  

## Markdown Basics

There are multiple Markdown variations.  R Markdown uses [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) which is useful for authoring technical documentation.    Other variations include [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), and [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/).

The following is a quick summary of basic Markdown. 

### Headers

### Formatting

```
Use *astericks* or _underscores_ for italics.

Use double **astericks** or double __underscores__ for bold.  

Strikethrough text with two ~~tidles~~

Subscripts are writting by surrounding the subscripted text by tidles. H~2~O is a liquid. 

Superscripts are written by surrounding the superscripted text by  2^10^ is 1024.

Use three or more `-` characters at the beginning of a line followed by a newline to create a horizontal rule
```

### Lists

This is a bullet list.  You can use `*`, `+`, or `-` to begin each item.
